# Introduction

ctgPHYL is an R package that combines a variety of visualization packages. By 
installing this package, users have a streamlined, simplified way to build 
trees with these packages using one function call with a single dataset and 
the desired visualization package name as a parameter. 
Currently supported packages are:

- timescape
- cellscape
- mapscape


# Installing ctgPHYL

## Installing htmlwidgets (Optional)

To optionally save cellscape, timescape, and mapscape plots as self-contained 
files, the  htmlwidgets package must also be installed.

```{r optional, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("htmlwidgets")
```


## Installing Bioconductor and the ctgPHYL package

ctgPHYL requires Bioconductor 3.12 or higher.  For more information on 
Bioconductor, please see their website at https://bioconductor.org.  To install
Bioconductor and ctgPHYL, run the following commands:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# For R version >= 3.5
if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE))
    install.packages("BiocManager")
BiocManager::install("ctgPHYL")
```

Once Bioconductor is installed, it can be used to install some of the other 
packages needed for this vignette, as follows:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
BiocManager::install(c("cellscape", "timescape", "mapscape"))
```

After installing, attach the ctgPHYL package with the following command:

```{r loadCTG, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results='hide'}
library(ctgPHYL)
```


# Preparing a ctgPHYLset object

The ctgPHYL workflow is based around a single data class.  Details for loading 
the data for and constructing an example ctgPHYLset object suitable for this 
vignette can be found in the following section.

## Loading the Data

A ctgPHYLset object that will support all of the tree types in the ctgPHYL 
requires a variety of data types, as each tree type has specific requirements.
For this vignette, we will construct a toy object, using examples provided in 
the vignettes for each tree package.  Note that these data do not necessarily 
correlate to one another in any way and are strictly for example purposes. 

```{r loadRaw, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results='hide'}
# load data for cellscape
cs_tree_edges <-
  read.csv(system.file("extdata", "cnv_tree_edges.csv",
                        package = "cellscape"))
cs_cnv_data <- read.csv(system.file("extdata", "cnv_data.csv",
                                    package = "cellscape"))
cs_sc_annot <- read.csv(system.file("extdata", "cnv_annots.tsv",
                                    package = "cellscape"),
                        sep = "\t")
cs_clone_colours <- data.frame(clone_id = c("1", "2", "3"),
                               colour = c("7fc97f", "beaed4", "fdc086"))
# load data for timescape
ts_tree_edges <-
  read.csv(system.file("extdata", "AML_tree_edges.csv",
                       package = "timescape"))
ts_clonal_prev <-
  read.csv(system.file("extdata", "AML_clonal_prev.csv",
                       package = "timescape"))
ts_mutations <- read.csv(system.file("extdata", "AML_mutations.csv",
                                     package = "timescape"))
ts_perturbations <- data.frame(pert_name = c("Chemotherapy"),
                               prev_tp = c("Diagnosis"))

# load data for mapscape
ms_clonal_prev <-
  read.csv(system.file("extdata", "A21_clonal_prev.csv",
                       package = "mapscape"))
ms_mutations <- read.csv(system.file("extdata", "A21_mutations.csv",
                                     package = "mapscape"))
ms_sample_locations <- read.csv(system.file("extdata",
                                            "A21_sample_locations.csv",
                                            package = "mapscape"))
ms_tree_edges <- read.csv(system.file("extdata", "A21_tree.csv",
                                      package = "mapscape"))

ms_img_ref <- system.file("extdata", "A21_anatomical_image.png",
                          package = "mapscape")

ms_sample_ids <- c("H", "F", "J", "D", "A", "I", "C", "E", "G")
```


## Constructing a ctgPHYLset object

To construct the ctgPHYLset for this vignette, we will create an empty 
ctgPHYLset and then add in the data loaded in the previous step.

```{r constructctgPHYLset, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results='hide'}
toyPHYLset <- newctgPHYLset()
```


### Adding Data: cellscape, timescape, and mapscape
The cellscape, timescape, and mapscape tree methods require properly formatted 
data.  We can add the example data loaded earlier to our ctgPHYLset.  Because 
each piece of these data corresponds to a parameter used by one of the 
packages, when it is added to a ctgPHYLset, the parameter name must be 
supplied.  Additional details concerning these parameters can be found in the 
respective package's documentation.
Note:  Although these some of these data share the same parameter name, these 
example data are not interchangable.

```{r addEscape}
# store cellscape data
cellscapeData(toyPHYLset, "clone_colours") <- cs_clone_colours
cellscapeData(toyPHYLset, "tree_edges") <- cs_tree_edges 
cellscapeData(toyPHYLset, "cnv_data") <- cs_cnv_data
cellscapeData(toyPHYLset, "sc_annot") <- cs_sc_annot

# store timescape data
timescapeData(toyPHYLset, "tree_edges") <- ts_tree_edges
timescapeData(toyPHYLset, "clonal_prev") <- ts_clonal_prev
timescapeData(toyPHYLset, "mutations") <- ts_mutations
timescapeData(toyPHYLset, "perturbations") <- ts_perturbations

# store mapscape data
mapscapeData(toyPHYLset, "clonal_prev") <- ms_clonal_prev
mapscapeData(toyPHYLset, "mutations") <- ms_mutations
mapscapeData(toyPHYLset, "sample_locations") <- ms_sample_locations
mapscapeData(toyPHYLset, "tree_edges") <- ms_tree_edges
mapscapeData(toyPHYLset, "img_ref") <- ms_img_ref
mapscapeData(toyPHYLset, "sample_ids") <- ms_sample_ids
```


# Using ctgPHYL

To use ctgPHYL, call the generate_tree function with the desired tree method 
and ctgPHYLset object. 

## Using cellscape:

To use our example ctgPHYLset and the cellscape method, we would type the 
following:

```{r genCellscape, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
toyPHYLset <- generate_tree(dataSet = toyPHYLset, treeType = "cellscape")
```

This stores the final tree in the originalTrees slot of the ctgPHYLset object, 
a simplified `r CRANpkg("igraph")` version of the tree in the 
*treeList* within the ctgPHYLset object, and if necessary creates a new 
folder, called "CTG-Output", that contains a folder called "SIFs" containing 
the .SIF text file for the final tree, and a folder called "Plots" containing 
an .html file with the final product.  The .html version is interactive, but a 
static version is displayed here.

```{r cellscapePlot, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, out.width="400px"}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path("figures", "cellscape.png"))
```

## Using timescape:

To use our example ctgPHYLset and the timescape method, we would type the 
following:

```{r genTimeScape, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
toyPHYLset <- generate_tree(dataSet = toyPHYLset, treeType = "timescape")
```

This stores the final tree in the originalTrees slot of the ctgPHYLset object, 
a simplified `r CRANpkg("igraph")` version of the tree in the 
*treeList* within the ctgPHYLset object, and if necessary creates a new 
folder, called "CTG-Output", that contains a folder called "SIFs" containing 
the .SIF text file for the final tree, and a folder called "Plots" containing 
an .html file with the final product.  The .html version is interactive, but a 
static version is displayed here.

```{r timescapePlot, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, out.width="400px"}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path("figures", "timescape.png"))
```

## Using mapscape:

To use our example ctgPHYLset and the mapscape method, we would type the 
following:

```{r genMapscape, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
toyPHYLset <- generate_tree(dataSet = toyPHYLset, treeType = "mapscape")
```

This stores the final tree in the originalTrees slot of the ctgPHYLset object, 
a simplified `r CRANpkg("igraph")` version of the tree in the 
*treeList* within the ctgPHYLset object, and if necessary creates a new 
folder, called "CTG-Output", that contains a folder called "SIFs" containing 
the .SIF text file for the final tree, and a folder called "Plots" containing 
an .html file with the final product.  The .html version is interactive, but a 
static version is displayed here.

```{r mapscapePlot, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, out.width="400px"}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path("figures", "mapscape.png"))
```


# Replotting Trees

If at some point we wish to view the plot of a tree generated after it's been 
created, but don't want to have to regenerate it and all its files, ctgPHYL has 
a function, plotOriginalTree(), that will reproduce a plot stored in a 
ctgPHYLset object. To use this function, we must know the name of the tree we 
wish to plot.  We can view the names of the trees in our toyPHYLset using the 
names() function.

```{r getNames, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
names(originalTrees(toyPHYLset))
```
```{r displayNames, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
n <- c("cellscape", "timescape", "mapscape")
print(n)
```

Once we have the names, we can choose a tree to plot. Let's plot the 
"cellscape" tree again.

```{r plotTree, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
plotOriginalTree(toyPHYLset, "cellscape")
```

```{r plotOriginal, echo=FALSE, out.width="400px"}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path("figures", "cellscape.png"))
```

Using this function eliminates the need to regenerate the tree to view a plot 
that was already created, thereby saving time for trees that require extensive 
computations to generate.

To store your analysis session result for later use, you can use the .Rda 
format.

```{r save, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE, message = FALSE}
save(toyPHYLset, file = "toyPHYLset.Rda")
```
